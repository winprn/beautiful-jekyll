My name is Ly Dinh Minh Man. I'm currently a 12-grade highschool student in Le Hong Phong Highschool for the gifted in Vietnam.
And you may also found me at some places with username "winprn" (like this blog!).

### Why does this blog exist?
It quite a while since I broke up with my ex. This blog came out just for entertaining purpose and for me to note down some stuff that I need to remember longer.

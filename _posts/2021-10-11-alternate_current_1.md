### Introduction

Welcome! I decided to build this blog with a serie about Alternate Current (AC) which is one topic that I'm learning right now in Physics. This serie could include several parts as the topic is complicated itself. Hope that what I write here will be undestandable and help you have a clearer sight in this topic. Let's start off by find out [What's is AC?](#definition)

### Definition
<details>
    <summary>What's is an electric current?</summary>

    * An electric current is a stream of charged particles, such as electrons (-) or ions (+/-). Electric currents don't have direction and their amperage is constant.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What's is a directed current?</summary>

    * A directed current is an electric current but it has its own direction, which never change over time and its amperage can be changed.
</details>

Firstly, we gonna find out how can we create a alternate current: let's have a rectangle bronze wireframe has its electric charge as S, with N rings spinning around its symmetric axis (define as xx') at a constant speed (with angular velocity is $\omega$) in an uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ ($\vec{B}$ is perpendicular with xx').

As the wireframe spins, there will be a electromagnetic induction due to Faraday's law. If we connect it to an external circuit, an electric current will occur in that electric circuit and its amperage will harmonically oscillate with angular velocity equals to $\omega$ and we call it an alternate current as in every time the wireframe spins 1 loop, the electric current will change its direction twice.

### Voltage and amperage of an alternating current

Alternating currents are accompanied by alternating voltages, which can be described by a mathematical function of time: $u = U_0sin(\omega t + \varphi_u)$. With:
* $u$ (V) is the instantaneous voltage at time $t$ (s).
* $U_0$ (V) is the maximum voltage.
* $\omega$ (rad/s) is the angular frequency.
* $\varphi_u$ (rad) is the initial phase.

The amperage of the electric current which flows in our electric circuit can be calculated as follow: $i=I_0sin(\omega t + \varphi_i)$. With:
* $i$ (A) is the instantaneous voltage at time $t$ (s).
* $I_0$ (A) is the maximum voltage.
* $\omega$ (rad/s) is the angular frequency.
* $\varphi_i$ (rad) is the initial phase.

I think that's enough for now, in the next parts, I'll introduce you more complicated fomulas related to voltage, amperage and we'll have a look at resistor, capacitor, and inductor when assembled in a series circuit. Thanks for reading!

### Introduction

Welcome! I decided to build this blog with a series about Alternate Current (AC), which is one topic that I am learning right now in Physics. This series could include several parts as the topic is complicated itself. I hope that what I write here will be understandable and help you understand this topic. Let us start by finding out [What's is AC?](#definition)

### Definition
<details>
    <summary>What's is an electric current?</summary>

    * An electric current is a stream of charged particles, such as electrons (-) or ions (+/-). Electric currents don't have direction and their amperage is constant.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What's is a directed current?</summary>

    * A directed current is an electric current but it has its own direction, which never change over time and its amperage can be changed.
</details>

Firstly, we are going to find out how can we create an alternate current: let's have a rectangle bronze wireframe that has its electric charge as S, with N rings spinning around its symmetric axis (define as xx') at a constant speed (with angular velocity is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$\omega$">) in a uniform magnetic field <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$\vec{B}$"> (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$\vec{B}$"> is perpendicular with xx').

As the wireframe spins, there will be an electromagnetic induction due to Faraday's law. Suppose we connect it to an external circuit. In that case, an electric current will occur in that electric circuit, and its amperage will harmonically oscillate with angular velocity equals to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$\omega$">. We call it an alternate current as every time the wireframe spins one loop; the electric current will change its direction twice.

### Voltage and amperage of an alternating current

Alternating currents are accompanied by alternating voltages, which can be described by a mathematical function of time: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$u = U_0sin(\omega t %2B \varphi_u)$">. With:
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$u$"> (V) is the instantaneous voltage at time <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$t$ "> (s).
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$U_0$"> (V) is the maximum voltage.
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$\omega$"> (rad/s) is the angular frequency.
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$\varphi_u$"> (rad) is the initial phase.

The amperage of the electric current which flows in our electric circuit can be calculated as follow: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$i=I_0sin(\omega t %2B \varphi_i)$">. With:
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$i$"> (A) is the instantaneous amperage at time <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$t$ "> (s).
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$I_0$"> (A) is the maximum amperage.
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$\omega$"> (rad/s) is the angular frequency.
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$\varphi_i$"> (rad) is the initial phase.

I think that is enough for now. In the following parts, I will introduce you to more complicated formulas related to voltage, amperage. We'll have a look at the resistor, capacitor, and inductor when assembled in a series circuit. Thanks for reading!

I created a blog! (finally after some delay).  

What exactly am I gonna write here? Well, I will share my experiment in my competitive programming (CP) path. I've been doing it since I was in grade 8 or 9. Sometimes, I also post about interesting knowledges in Maths, Chemistry or Physics just to make myself remember it longer.

If you want me to share my thoughts about some topics, feel free to leave a comment down below (hope it works)!

Oh and some last words, most of the blog here will be written in English, though my mother tongue is Vietnamese. I found it easier to spread my blog around the world if I write it in a top well-known language like English (and it's the only foreign language that I know 🙁). But sometimes, I may write blogs in both language if I have fun doing it.
